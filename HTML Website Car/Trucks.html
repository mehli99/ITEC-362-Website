            <p>The history of the truck is as old as automobile history itself. Many trucks lead back to the late 19th century
                They were just modified versions of existing vehicles designed to carry goods and equipment more efficiently.
                Many companies in the 1910s began coming out with trucks and they became common place in agriculture and industry.
                As time went on into the 1930s and 40s the pickup truck became a more than just a work truck, many people started 
                buying them as personal vehicles to drive everyday. During this boom in popularity, many companies added comfort features
                such as smoother suspension. in the 50s and 60s many companies experimented with bigger and better engines and that aslo
                included trucks in the picture. They became bigger and more rugged and turned into an American icon. During the 1970s, 
                the oil crisis happened and engines got smaller, even in trucks. Some companies began importing to the USA such as Nissan and Toyota.
                This brought much more competition to the growing pickup market. These imported trucks were also smaller and featured smaller engines.
                These smaller trucks catered to the individual who wanted to drive but not spend too much on gas. 
                During the 80s these smaller trucks boomed and many are still around due to their robust build and great reliablity. 
                In the 90s-early 2000s, trucks became the ultimate daily driver and all around vehicle. Many trucks started to include crew cabs
                in order to fit more people. The pickup truck became the ultimate family vehicle. In the present the pickup truck continues to be the best 
                selling vehicle in the USA and is dominate in other markets around the world.
