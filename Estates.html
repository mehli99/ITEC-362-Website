            <p>Estates or Wagons are another type of vehicle that saw a big burst in popularity in the 70s and 80s. 
            These cars were designed to carry 5-8 passengers and were often configurable to carry loads when needed. Some were paired with larger engines to tow and do more things than a traditional car would. 
            An estate was a go to choose for large families that did not want a van and was the choice before SUVs became mainstream.
             An Estate shares more similarities to a sedan as the frames and the way they handle on the roads are very similar making them easy to drive and maneuver. Wagons aslo can go by "longroofs" or "touring".

            <p>The car in the picture above is the BMW M3 Estate or wagon. This car is the first of its kind officially. The BMW M3 generations have an interesting history as BMW likes to make 
            spin off cars. For example, there is an M3 pickup. </p>
