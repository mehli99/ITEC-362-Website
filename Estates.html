            <p>Estates or Wagons are another type of vehicle that saw a big burst in popularity in the 70s and 80s. 
            These cars were designed to carry 5-8 passengers and were often configurable to carry loads when needed. Some were paired with larger engines to tow and do more things than a traditional car would. An estate was a go to choose for large families that did not want a van and was the choice before SUVs became mainstream.
             An Estate shares more similarities to a sedan as the frames and the way they handle on the roads are very similar making them easy to drive and maneuver.
