            <p>The first vehicle being covered will be coupes and sedans. A coupe is a lot like a sedan but the main feature being only two doors, front and passenger a coupe is also more than likely a 2-seater. Some cars come with 4 seats in a coupe but donâ€™t really have the leg room for those rear passengers. A great example of that is the ford mustang.
                The S-95 model is the one I am most familiar with this configuration but many coupes have those extra seats for the sake of saying they can fit more than two people. The other type of car is a sedan. Sedans were very popular commuters back in the early days of automobiles. Sedans are comfortable cars that seat up to 4-5 people including the driver. 
                Sedans have spacious interiors and often allow a more comfortable ride for passengers than the sportier coupes. Sedans have been made since the beginning with the most popular one starting as the 
                Ford Model T. This was the first car that was mass produced. This paved the way for sedans and cars to be more readily available to the public. Since the model T many sedans were maid and each decade they got more powerful and could carry more people. Coupes were sportier and costed more than a typical sedan. 
                Coupes had bigger engines and could go faster. Sedans were family oriented and carried comfortable styles and seating for passengers and the driver.</p>
